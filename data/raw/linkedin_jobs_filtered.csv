A DRI postdoctoral research position has long served as the first step to a successful research career at DRI and at other institutions. Postdoctoral researchers hired from this posting may be eligible for promotion to regular faculty (Assistant Research Professor) upon the successful completion of their postdoc. To support the postdoc in working towards this goal, the DRI division the postdoc is hired under may provide professional development support for the incumbent to begin to develop their own research program as a postdoc. DRI postdocs are eligible to serve as PIs on research grants, and the incumbent will be encouraged to collaborate with colleagues across DRI and at other institutions. Promotion from Postdoctoral Researcher to Assistant Research Professor can occur when the Postdoctoral Researcher successfully demonstrates the ability to develop and sustain their own funding. The incumbent will also have the opportunity to participate in both formal and informal early career mentoring programs provided by DRI Human Resources.

DRI faculty are supported through competitive grants and contracts with external funding agencies, and faculty therefore have access to considerable administrative support and an Institute-wide entrepreneurial approach to maintaining success in developing funding programs. DRI has been successful in using this model to create scientific breakthroughs and applied science solutions to some of the most challenging problems facing the nation and the world for over 60 years. 

DRI is a research-focused institution and teaching and advising of graduate students is not required but is possible through the Graduate Schools at UNR and UNLV.

Salary / Benefits

DRI offers a benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, and life insurance, 6.2% retirement match, 1.25 annual leave days per month, a beginning balance of 15 sick leave days, 12 paid holidays, educational benefits, and the option to participate in a flexible spending account or health savings account. Additionally, there is no state income tax and no social security deduction. This position may be eligible for relocation assistance dependent on division funding.

Organizational Summary
For more than 60 years, the Desert Research Institute has functioned as the nonprofit, non-degree-granting environmental research arm of the Nevada System of Higher Education. Focused on basic and applied research, the Institute’s unique model blends academia with entrepreneurship to deliver a wide variety of scientific services and research-generated knowledge to its sponsors and clients.

DRI faculty are nontenured and responsible for generating their own salaries and Institute operating revenues through external funding.

We are the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute (IBRI). We are a leading translational research institute that advances academic and industry science through collaboration to improve patient health outcomes. Building your career at the IBRI in Indianapolis’ 16 Tech Innovation District, means being part of a team of renowned scientists, creative thinkers, and innovative leaders.

Today’s research is being driven by significant advances in our abilities to study complex disease processes and propose new ways to improve patients’ lives. To reflect the evolving nature of life sciences research and encourage synergies through collaboration, we’re enhancing our integrated capabilities, adding depth to how we approach patient-informed translational science and pursuing four foundational areas of scientific focus. These four areas will provide us the core talent and capability to pursue translational science in this new patient-centric framework:

Disease, Systems, Pathways – We’re working to better understand diabetes and identify new ways to combat the disease. We’re applying this learning to other diseases that share common systems and pathways.
Molecular Innovation – We’re developing new capabilities for molecular design and drug discovery to investigate disease processes and pursue new therapeutic approaches.
Integrated Data Sciences – We’re pursuing advanced data sciences to create novel end-user inspired solutions that address complex analysis, simulation, and prediction across the translational sciences.
Enabling Technologies – We’re building a rich platform of enabling technologies that give our scientists, partners, and collaborators access to the best tools to solve complex scientific problems.

The IBRI’s vision is to build a world-class organization of researchers, innovators and business professionals that catalyze activities across the Indiana (and beyond) life sciences community. To achieve that vision, we look for curious and collaborative team members who are energized by innovation, guided by integrity, and inspired by diversity.

The Opportunity:
We are seeking a Director of Project Management to build and establish a Project Management function within the IBRI.

What We Do

We build on the strength of our research and development expertise and a distinctive, entrepreneurial culture that encourages diversity, innovation, creativity, sustainability, and, simply, fun. Since inception, our mission has been to find a cure for pulmonary arterial hypertension and other life-threatening diseases. Toward this goal we have successfully gained FDA approval for five medicines, we are always conducting new clinical trials, and we are working to create an unlimited supply of manufactured organs for transplantation.

We are the first publicly traded biotech or pharmaceutical company to take the form of a public benefit corporation (PBC). Our public benefit purpose is to provide a brighter future for patients through (a) the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies; and (b) technologies that expand the availability of transplantable organs. At the same time, we seek to provide our shareholders with superior financial performance and our communities with earth-sensitive energy utilization.

Our company was founded by an entrepreneur whose daughter was diagnosed with a life-threatening condition. She sought to find treatment options and a cure for her daughter and patients like her. We are founder-led and relentless in our pursuit of “medicines for life”. We continue to research and develop treatments for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and other orphan diseases.

The trucking industry is the backbone of the global economy. More than 70% of what we consume in the U.S. is moved by trucks. Those trucks are powered by over 3.5 million drivers per year and create over $700B in annual revenue. Trucking is a massive industry but it is a traditional industry and like many traditional industries, it is ripe for innovation.
CloudTrucks is building the operating system for trucking and is the first platform specifically designed to empower truck drivers. Our all-in-one, “business in a box” solution optimizes and automates operations and accelerates cash-flow for drivers, so they can focus on building their business.

The Marketplace team at CloudTrucks tackles complex challenges with smart solutions in market prediction, pricing, and route optimization. We utilize data from myriad sources, including IoT, supply and demand-side financial & market transactions, economic time series, and user behavior streams. Given our unique position in the market at the intersection of shippers, carrier, and brokers our goal is to help drivers maximize profit and quality of life through the power of machine learning and AI.

As an ML Engineer, you will own ML models and algorithms end-to-end for solving customer problems. You will also lead architecture decisions and guide technical strategy towards innovative and pragmatic solutions which bias us towards a superlative customer experience.

How We Use ML at CloudTrucks
Dispatch AI - Drivers are always focused on delivering their next load but the optimal dispatch schedule has to take into account not just the next stop but also the likely future stops the next stop will lead to. Dispatch AI is an automated system we’ve developed to leverage our internal market data and forecasting models to help drivers earn the most money on the optimal route.
Prospector - In order to prosper in the competitive freight market our drivers need the best loads at the best prices. Prospector, our “bidbot”, identifies and bids on ideal loads available in load auctions. It uses various supply and demand models to generate bid prices ensuring we win the correct auctions to provide our drivers with more lucrative opportunities.
Personalized Load Scoring - Every driver is unique and has their own preferences. We developed a personalized load scoring model based on driver booking histories to help us determine which drivers will prefer which loads. We use our personalized scoring in various features including sorting search results and identifying recommended loads for push notification.

Responsibilities
Design, implement, iterate, and manage ML models and algorithms end-to-end to solve customer problems
Design, grow and operate our machine learning architecture prioritizing ease of use and automation
Make judicious build vs buy decisions for our current modeling needs while preparing for 10x data volume as we rapidly scale
Promote operational best practices for non-ML data products

What we are looking for
Strong technical background, including 4+ years of industry experience as an ML Engineer working on production systems
Self-motivated and comfortable operating in a dynamic environment with a strong sense of ownership and an ability to drive a project from start to finish
